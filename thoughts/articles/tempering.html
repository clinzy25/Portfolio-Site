          <p><a href='https://www.netflix.com/title/81254224'><u>The Social Dilemma</u></a> is a Netflix documentary that unpacks the negative impacts of social media on our society, and has led to new conversations about our relationship with technology. We are starting to realize that the way we currently use technology might not be in our best interest, or even in our interest at all. If you've considered how much time you spend on your phone, whether you are receiving quality information about the world, or how the addictive loops of the infinite scroll has affected your mind, you might be receptive to some strategies that allow us to reign in our devices and eliminate their manipulative characteristics. Turning some of these strategies into habits can reduce the amount of time we spend on our devices, thus improving our public discourse, information infrastructure, and the health of ourselves and our children.</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h2>time is our most valuable asset</h2>
          <br>
          <p>I mean this quite literally. Data has surpassed all other commodities in terms of value, and the companies that trade it are the largest and most profitable the world has ever seen. To extract this data, social media platforms record the browsing habits of their users down to the second to produce hyper-accurate predictive models. These models are far more accurate than those produced by traditional market research because they are generated with machine learning and refined automatically as we use the software from day to day. Their value is manifested in interest from advertisers, who pay the platforms for the advertising space. The second layer of value appears when the models are used to fine-tune our news feeds and provide engaging content that will hold our attention. The more of our time we give to these platforms, the more ads they can show us, and the more accurate and valuable the models become. This is a relatively new business model where profit is a direct function of time on device, and thus, they have every incentive to design and optimize their platforms for this. This is the attention economy.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The algorithms that generate our news feeds are remarkably good at keeping us on the platforms. In 2020, Americans spent an average of <a href='https://elitecontentmarketer.com/screen-time-statistics/'><u>3.5 hours per day on their phones</u></a>, amounting to about 50 days per year. Other countries, like the Phillipines, see numbers higher than 10 hours per day. The average smartphone user checks their phone 58 times per day. We've known for some time that social media is addictive in nature, but the trends continue to rise. When we look at the statistics, or look around us in public, it's clear that we are giving far too much of our valuable time to these companies. Fortunately, they still operate within the confines of supply and demand. If enough of us step in and reduce our time on device, we can put a serious dent in their supply of data, and the companies will have to change the way they do business.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Unfortunately its not as simple as "don't use your phone as much". If you've ever tried to kick an addiction, you know that sometimes you need to hack yourself. Make small, incremental changes to your habits and measure the results. If you're interested in reducing the amount of time you spend on your phone, the most impactful thing you can do is delete social media apps and any app that monetizes your time and attention (you can still use these apps on your computer, see #6 below). You should then make small changes to the device that temper it's functionality, and add friction to the UI.</p>
          <br>
          <ol>
            <li class='ordered-list'>Use a pattern unlock and make it intentionally difficult to open.</li>
            <p class='sublist'>Change the pattern once a week. This will add a bit of friction every time you try to use your phone.</p><br>
            <li class='ordered-list'>Turn off all unnecessary notifications.</li>
              <p class='sublist'>Give each one you keep a different noise/vibration pattern to reduce ambiguity of the stimulus. I have only 3 apps on my phone for which I allow notifications.</p><br>
            <li class='ordered-list'>Organize and consolidate your apps.</li>
              <p class='sublist'>Move all unused apps into a folder to hide them, or delete them. Create one homescreen and, if needed, one extra page of apps. You are aiming for perceived control of the device by knowing where everything is and it's exact utility.</p><br>
            <li class='ordered-list'>Allocate "screenless" time in your day.</li>
              <p class='sublist'>A good starting point is the hour after you wake up and the hour before you go to sleep. Replace with healthy routines that don't involve technology and promote melatonin production.</p><br>
            <li class='ordered-list'>Observe a Digital Sabbath.</li>
              <p class='sublist'>Abstain from screens entirely for one day of the week. Especially important if you work on computers.</p><br>
            <li class='ordered-list'>Use social media on a computer instead of your phone.</li>
              <p class='sublist'>Simply sitting in an upright position in a single location can be enough friction to reduce social media use. You can make it a bit more difficult by always logging out and disabling autocomplete on the login form. Either way, the main idea is that social media is not available to you at all times from any location.</p><br>
            <li class='ordered-list'>Pick an ugly wallpaper.</li>
              <p class='sublist'>Or enable grayscale during work hours. Android and iOS both have this feature. This is just another way to make our devices a bit less gratifying to use.</p><br>
            <li class='ordered-list'>Switch to a phone carrier where you pay only for the data you use.</li>
              <p class='sublist'>This will discourage you from scrolling outside the house because you will have to pay for it.</p><br>
            <li class='ordered-list'><a href='https://www.rescuetime.com/'><u>Rescue Time</u></a></li>
              <p class='sublist'>An app that allows you to view device usage statistics including time spent on specific web sites and apps. Set goals for minimizing screen time and hold yourself accountable.</p><br>
            <li class='ordered-list'><a href='https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stayfocusd/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji'><u>Stay Focusd</u></a></li>
              <p class='sublist'>If you're still having trouble, use this browser extention to block time wasting sites during specific periods or all together.</p><br>
            <li class='ordered-list'>Be intentional with your time.</li>
              <p class='sublist'>This is my favorite and easily the most effective. When you want to do something specific, whether it be work related, exercise, or watching a movie with family, <em>remove your phone from the room.</em> If your phone is not needed for an activity, it's mere presence can be a distraction. Get rid of it, you won't miss it.</p>

          <h2>our shared reality</h2>
          <br>
          <p>There's more to this than just time on device. The proliferation of social media into our news and information infrastructure has wreaked havoc on our public discourse and democratic process. We find ourselves in a world where information and interpretations of events can be generated and amplified to huge audiences by literally anybody. This should be a good thing. The essence of democracy is everyone having the ability to form and voice their own opinion. The problem arises when the social media becomes the primary vector for news and decides what to show you based on clicks, likes, and popularity. Given that fear mongering, violence, and extremism tend to attract the most viewers, the algorithms will always choose this kind content over others. This wouldn't be so bad if the outrage was in one direction toward, say, a corrupt government or corporation. Instead we direct it at each other. Because our news feeds are all different, constantly affirming our own beliefs and convictions, never presenting us with other perspectives and opinions, and sending us deeper down our own personal rabbit holes, the dividing lines between our intellectual differences have become impenetrable.</p>
          <br>
          The result is a society that is more divided, outraged, extremist, isolated, and vicious toward each other than ever before. There is no shared reality and everyone has their own facts. We can't communicate, we can't compromise, and we can't make progress. I believe it is crucial that we return to earth with a new method for attaining and digesting news from the internet. It's quite simple, and a bit archaic, but hear me out.
          <br>
          <ol>
            <li class='ordered-list'>Set up an RSS feed using Feedly or Inoreader.</li>
              <p class='sublist'>An RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feed is a great way to take the reigns of content generation away from social media's pervasive algorithms. You create your own news feed that populates as your chosen sources produce content.</p><br>
            <li class='ordered-list'>Add the most unbiased, objective news sources you can find.</li>
              <p class='sublist'>I admittedly don't have a formula for this. It will take some work. There are many sites that claim to be fact checkers and media bias empiricists. Ultimately you should decide for yourself using as many resources as necessary.</p><br>
            <li class='ordered-list'>Add some news sources that aren't aligned with your beliefs.</li>
              <p class='sublist'>This will help you understand people who disagree with you and uncover some of your own biases you didn't know you had.</p><br>
            <li class='ordered-list'>Read entire articles.</li>
              <p class='sublist'>Don't scan headlines, read the whole thing.</p><br>
            <li class='ordered-list'>Don't read comments.</li>
              <p class='sublist'>Form your own opinion about what you read. Reading comments can drag you into group-think and outrage culture.</p><br>
            <li class='ordered-list'>Recognize your biases and weaknesses.</li>
              <p class='sublist'>Consider your initial reaction to an article headline, see if it can be changed or at least tempered by the end of the article. News often tries to grab you emotionally and appeal to the inherent biases of its target audience. Don't be in the target audience.</p><br>
            <li class='ordered-list'>Check news infrequently.</li>
              <p class='sublist'>Check news once or twice a week on a regular schedule for a regular amount of time. I check news every Sunday for an hour, and I sort by top stories of the week. I know that if I don't set these parameters, I'll fall into the same loops of social media on my RSS feed. </p><br>
          </ol>
          <br>
          <p>If you try this method, you might feel some pangs of nostalgia. It wasn't too long ago that professional writers and journalists were respected purveyors of truth and the pillars of democracy. It's time we return to them the attention they deserve, and stop entrusting our world views to our friends and social media personalities on the same shallow platforms where we share memes and cat videos.</p>
          <br>
          <p>At the risk of sounding like a total Luddite, I'll share one final concern I have with current technology trends.</p>
          <br>
